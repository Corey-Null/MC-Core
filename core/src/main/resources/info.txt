This plugin was made to act like a drag & drop to create an entire server which could be configured and released with minimal other plugins.
This plugin contains a variety of features such as a custom economy, a complex placeholder system, a custom chat system, and a custom permissions system.

You can set up this plugin to use vault if you wish, or you can use my custom vault plugin which is contained in the zip file downloaded.
My custom vault plugin will allow compatibility for all of your favorite plugins which want to use my economy or permissions system.

Configuration:
Each module has it's own folder for configuration (banmanager/economy/permissions/chat) which each have their own rules.
The messages.yml are located in an obvious order sorted by commands

These placeholders DO NOT work in the messages.yml, check the player.yml for setting up player formats and placeholders for the messages.yml and chat
Player placeholders for chat/player.yml:
{effective_prefix} = the prefix which is chosen between the player prefix and rank prefix (player prefix takes priority)
{player_prefix} = the prefix which is held by the player
{rank_prefix} = the rank's prefix
{inherited_prefixes} = this sorts through all the player's inherited ranks, sorts them based on ladder rank and lists their prefixes
{effective_suffix} = the suffix which is chosen between the player suffix and rank suffix (player suffix takes priority)
{player_suffix} = the suffix which is held by the player
{rank_suffix} = the rank's suffix
{inherited_suffixes} = this sorts through all the player's inherited ranks, sorts them based on ladder rank and lists their suffixes
{rank_name} = the rank's name
{inherited_names} = this sorts through all the player's inherited ranks, sorts them based on ladder rank and lists their names
{balance} = player's balance
{player} = player's displayname (with nickname)
{player_default} = player's name (without nickname)
{ping} = player's ping
